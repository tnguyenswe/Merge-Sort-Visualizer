# How to run the app

Within a terminal, do the following commands:

``` 
sudo npm install -g npm
sudo npm i react
git clone https://github.com/tnguyenswe/Merge-Sort-Visualizer.git 
cd merge-sort-visualizer
npm run build
npm run start
```

Now the app should be running, and you can navigate to localhost:3000 on your browser.

Here, you can make changes, to the code and see your changes live.

# How to make changes to the app

We're going to be using Visual Studio Code as our text editor. In general, most people tend to use Visual Studio Code for developing front end apps. So make sure to download it.

Once you've downloaded it, navigate to the merge-sort-visualizer repo.
