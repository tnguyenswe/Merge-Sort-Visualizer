# How to run the app

Within a terminal, do the following commands:

``` 
sudo npm install -g npm
sudo npm i react
git clone https://github.com/tnguyenswe/Merge-Sort-Visualizer.git 
cd merge-sort-visualizer
npm run build
npm run start
```

Now the app should be running, and you can navigate to localhost:3000 on your browser.

Here, you can make changes, to the code and see your changes live.
